Postdoctoral Associate, Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC), Albany, NY, U.S.A.

Aug 2016 – Aug 2021:

**The role of ammonia in atmospheric new particle formation and implications for cloud
condensation nuclei**

Research Project Assistant, Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC), Albany, NY, U.S.A.

Graduate Student, Dept. of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, University at Albany

* Developed a physicochemically explainable, robust, and computationally efficient machine learning representation for cloud condensation nuclei in GCMs, validated with the aid of DOE ARM data.
* Doctoral work resulted in 11 publications (1 under review) and 14 presentations.
* Led collaboration with 27 researchers supported by NSF, NASA, NOAA, and NRF (Korea).

*Jun 2015 – May 2016:*

**Some observations on lightning over the Bay of Bengal**

Co–guide, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, India

* Investigated the climatology of lightning over the Bay of Bengal which receives unusually high precipitation during the monsoon months, as well as displays high convective clouds - something peculiar for an oceanic region.
* Guided a Master’s student during his summer internship analyzing 18-year satellite data for lightning with sea surface temperature, CAPE, and salinity.

*Aug 2014 – May 2016:*

**Lightning Distribution over South Asia during Active and Break Spells of the Monsoon**

*Mar 2015 – May 2016:* Research Assistant, IITM Pune, India

*Aug 2014 – Mar 2015:* Masters Thesis Student, IITM Pune, India

* Studied the link between lightning activity and the axis of the monsoon trough using satellite (NASA TRMM LIS/OTD) and observational (in situ surface networks) data sets in context of intensity and duration of the active and break monsoon periods.

*Aug 2013 – Dec 2013:*

**Synthesis and Analysis of Mesoporous SnO<sub>2</sub> Nanoparticles**

Project Student, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, India

* Optimized synthesis of hollow mesoporous graphene encapsulated SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles aimed at improved lithium ion batteries: charge capacity, number of recharge cycles, and durability.

*Jan 2013 – Jul 2013:*

**Impacts of the Western Ghats on lightning**

Project Student, IITM Pune, India

* Uncovered the strong orographic effect of the Western Ghats on lightning distribution, especially during the onset and withdrawal phases of the monsoon season using satellite data.

*May 2012 – Jun 2012:*

**Understorey aves diversity and conservation along elevational gradients**

Summer Project Student, IISER Pune, India

* Studied the elevational distribution of understorey birds at Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary, Arunachal
Pradesh, India.

*May 2011 – Jul 2011:*

**Effect of anthropogenic aerosols from Mumbai on cloud electrification**

IASc-INSA-NASI Summer Research Fellow, IITM Pune, India

* Studied the effect of aerosols from a metropolitan city on lightning activity.

*Jun 2010 – Jul 2010:*

**Effect of Low Radiation Dose on *Fenneropenaeus indicus***

Summer Project Student, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Tirunelveli, India

* Optimized radiation doses for preservation of seafood and treatment of hospital wastes.
