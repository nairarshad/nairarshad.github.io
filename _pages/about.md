Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany and associated with its [Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC)](https://www.albany.edu/asrc) and [School of Public Health (SPH)](https://www.albany.edu/sph). I received my PhD in the Atmospheric Sciences from SUNY Albany and my Dual-Degree BS-MS in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. My research is aimed at contributing to our understanding of various impacts of atmospheric trace gases (particularly ammonia) and aerosols on weather & climate and public health using synergistic approaches that have cross-disciplinary implications. An atmospheric physicist by training, I seek to apply additional strengths in data science, numerical modeling, and machine learning & artificial intelligence towards our collective efforts at mitigating the climate crisis through improved understanding and modeling of the Earth system and its impacts on human health and well-being. Dr. Nair has a strong publication record, is an effective research communicator, has served as a reviewer for the NSF, Science, and multiple other journals, and mentors historically underrepresented and socioeconomically disadvantaged STEM students.
