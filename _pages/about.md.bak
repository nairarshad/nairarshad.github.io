Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany and associated with its [Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC)](https://www.albany.edu/asrc) and [School of Public Health (SPH)](https://www.albany.edu/sph). I received my PhD in the Atmospheric Sciences from the [University at Albany](https://www.albany.edu/) and my Dual-Degree BS-MS in Physics from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER)](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), Pune, India. 

My research is broadly aimed at contributing to our understanding of various impacts of atmospheric trace gases (particularly ammonia) and aerosols on climate and public health using synergistic approaches that have cross-disciplinary implications. 

An atmospheric physicist by training, I seek to apply additional strengths in data science, numerical modeling, and machine learning & artificial intelligence towards our collective efforts at mitigating the climate crisis through improved understanding and modeling of the Earth system and its impacts on human health and well-being.
